# Computational-Musicology

I’ve chosen a playlist called “old skuul HipHop” which I created myself, soon after I created my Spotify account. It’s called old skuul (old school) because it is a playlist full of my favorite Hip-Hop songs growing up as a kid/teenager. It consists of a variety of artist from a wide range of time (approximately from 1990 till 2010), and different forms of Hip-Hop, with the exclusion of my favorite Hip-Hop artist Eminem. That is because I created a different playlist with just his music.

The playlist has a big variety of Hip-Hop songs for various reasons. The first reason is that since the songs all come from a different time, there are a lot of different artists, with most of the time just one song in this playlist. This is because I only add the ones I really liked when I listened to their music. Only the Big names such as Tupac, B.I.G, 50 Cent etc. have multiple songs in this playlist. All the songs are recorded, so no live performance in this playlist.

I expect to find that all the songs are indeed from the same genre, and that there is a big probability that people who like one song, might like more songs from this playlist. The most typical songs in the playlist are: 50 Cent - In Da Club / Meek Mill - House Party / Lil Wayne Featuring Bruno Mars - Mirror.

I wanted to create a visual were you could see te 'evolution' of Hiphop music over the years which seemed possible since my playlist contains music from 1988 till 2017. But I could not get it to work and would get error messages with, so I ended up with a basic plot which looks at danceability, valance and energy, but does unfortunatelly does not distinquish per artist or year created..(i could not get it to work..)
